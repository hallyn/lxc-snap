Compile using:

	gcc -o lxc-snap lxc-snap.c /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblxc.so.0

Note we need to ship lxccontainer.h and lxclock.h with liblxc0

How can this be used?

First, create a directory backed container.  Now create an overlayfs snapshot
of it.  That snapshot is what you will begin using.  This is critical, because
all snapshots will reference the original directory backed rootfs, so if you
start makign changes to it, all snapshots will also reflect those changes, which
is not what you want.

So for example

	sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n base
	sudo lxc-clone -s -B overlayfs base mysql1

Now make initial customizations, and snapshot:

	sudo lxc-snap mysql1

This will create a snapshot container /var/lib/lxcsnaps/mysql1_0.  You can actually
start it up if you like using 'sudo lxc-start -P /var/lib/lxcsnaps -n mysql1_0'.
However, that is not recommended.

Next, make some more changes, and

	sudo lxc-snap mysql1

Do this a few times.  Now you realize you lost a change at step 3.  So you can

	sudo lxc-snap -r mysql1_2 mysql1_tmp

Now you can recover what you need from the (directory-backed) /var/lib/lxc/mysql1_tmp.
When you're done, destroy it

	sudo lxc-destroy -n mysql1_tmp

The

	lxc-snap -l

and

	lxc-snap -l mysql1

are not yet implemented, but are intended to make it easier to remember
what snapshots exist that you can go back to.
